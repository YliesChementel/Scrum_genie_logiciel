This paper presents Topiary, a headlinegeneration system that creates very
short, informative summaries for news
stories by combining sentence compression and unsupervised topic discovery.
We will show that the combination of
linguistically motivated sentence compression with statistically selected topic
terms performs better than either alone,
according to some automatic summary
evaluation measures. In addition we describe experimental results establishing
an appropriate extrinsic task on which to
measure the effect of summarization on
human performance. We demonstrate
the usefulness of headlines in comparison to full texts in the context of this
extrinsic task.
