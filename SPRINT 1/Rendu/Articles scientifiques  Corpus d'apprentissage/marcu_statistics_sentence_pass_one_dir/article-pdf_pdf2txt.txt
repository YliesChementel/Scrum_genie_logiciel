Abstract

When humans produce summaries of documents, they
do not simply extract sentences and concatenate them.
Rather, they create new sentences that are grammati-
cal, that cohere with one another, and that capture the
most salient pieces of information in the original doc-
ument. Given that large collections of text/abstract
pairs are available online, it is now possible to envision
algorithms that are trained to mimic this process. In
this paper, we focus on sentence compression, a sim-
pler version of this larger challenge. We aim to achieve
two goals simultaneously: our compressions should be
grammatical, and they should retain the most impor-
tant pieces of information. These two goals can con-
ﬂict. We devise both noisy-channel and decision-tree
approaches to the problem, and we evaluate results
against manual compressions and a simple baseline.

Introduction
Most of the research in automatic summarization
has focused on extraction,
i.e., on identifying the
most important clauses/sentences/paragraphs in texts
(see (Mani & Maybury 1999) for a representative col-
lection of papers). However, determining the most im-
portant textual segments is only half of what a summa-
rization system needs to do because, in most cases, the
simple catenation of textual segments does not yield
coherent outputs. Recently, a number of researchers
have started to address the problem of generating co-
herent summaries: McKeown et al. (1999), Barzilay et
al. (1999), and Jing and McKeown (1999) in the context
of multidocument summarization; Mani et al. (1999) in
the context of revising single document extracts; and
Witbrock and Mittal (1999) in the context of headline
generation.

The approach proposed by Witbrock and Mit-
tal (1999) is the only one that applies a probabilistic
model trained directly on (cid:3)Headline, Document(cid:4) pairs.
However, this model has yet to scale up to generat-
ing multiple-sentence abstracts as well as well-formed,
grammatical sentences. All other approaches employ
sets of manually written or semi-automatically derived

telligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.

rules for deleting information that is redundant, com-
pressing long sentences into shorter ones, aggregating
sentences, repairing reference links, etc.

Our goal is also to generate coherent abstracts. How-
ever, in contrast with the above work, we intend to
eventually use (cid:3)Abstract, Text(cid:4) tuples, which are widely
available, in order to automatically learn how to rewrite
Texts as coherent Abstracts. In the spirit of the work
in the statistical MT community, which is focused on
sentence-to-sentence translations, we also decided to fo-
cus ﬁrst on a simpler problem, that of sentence compres-
sion. We chose this problem for two reasons:
• First, the problem is complex enough to require the
development of sophisticated compression models:
Determining what is important in a sentence and
determining how to convey the important informa-
tion grammatically, using only a few words, is just a
scaled down version of the text summarization prob-
lem. Yet, the problem is simple enough, since we do
not have to worry yet about discourse related issues,
such as coherence, anaphors, etc.

• Second, an adequate solution to this problem has
an immediate impact on several applications. For
example, due to time and space constraints, the
generation of TV captions often requires only the
most important parts of sentences to be shown on a
screen (Linke-Ellis 1999; Robert-Ribes et al. 1999).
A good sentence compression module would there-
fore have an impact on the task of automatic cap-
tion generation. A sentence compression module
can also be used to provide audio scanning ser-
vices for the blind (Grefenstette 1998).
In gen-
eral, since all systems aimed at producing coher-
ent abstracts implement manually written sets of
sentence compression rules (McKeown et al. 1999;
Mani, Gates, & Bloedorn 1999; Barzilay, McKeown,
& Elhadad 1999), it is likely that a good sentence
compression module would impact the overall quality
of these systems as well. This becomes particularly
important for text genres that use long sentences.

In this paper, we present two approaches to the sen-
tence compression problem. Both take as input a se-
quence of words W = w1, w2, . . . , wn (one sentence).

An algorithm may drop any subset of these words. The
words that remain (order unchanged) form a compres-
sion. There are 2n compressions to choose from—some
are reasonable, most are not. Our ﬁrst approach de-
velops a probabilistic noisy-channel model for sentence
compression. The second approach develops a decision-
based, deterministic model.

A noisy-channel model for sentence
compression
This section describes a probabilistic approach to the
compression problem. In particular, we adopt the noisy
channel framework that has been relatively successful in
a number of other NLP applications, including speech
recognition (Jelinek 1997), machine translation (Brown
1993), part-of-speech tagging (Church 1988),
et al.
transliteration (Knight & Graehl 1998), and informa-
tion retrieval (Berger & Laﬀerty 1999).

In this framework, we look at a long string and imag-
ine that (1) it was originally a short string, and then
(2) someone added some additional, optional text to it.
Compression is a matter of identifying the original short
string. It is not critical whether or not the “original”
string is real or hypothetical. For example, in statistical
machine translation, we look at a French string and say,
“This was originally English, but someone added ‘noise’
to it.” The French may or may not have been translated
from English originally, but by removing the noise, we
can hypothesize an English source—and thereby trans-
late the string. In the case of compression, the noise
consists of optional text material that pads out the core
signal. For the larger case of text summarization, it may
be useful to imagine a scenario in which a news editor
composes a short document, hands it to a reporter, and
tells the reporter to “ﬂesh it out” . . . which results in
the article we read in the newspaper. As summarizers,
we may not have access to the editor’s original version
(which may or may not exist), but we can guess at it—
which is where probabilities come in.

As in any noisy channel application, we must solve

three problems:
• Source model. We must assign to every string s a
probability P(s), which gives the chance that s is gen-
erated as an “original short string” in the above hy-
pothetical process. For example, we may want P(s)
to be very low if s is ungrammatical.

• Channel model. We assign to every pair of strings
(cid:3)s, t(cid:4) a probability P(t | s), which gives the chance
that when the short string s is expanded, the result
is the long string t. For example, if t is the same
as s except for the extra word “not,” then we may
want P(t | s) to be very low. The word “not” is not
optional, additional material.

• Decoder. When we observe a long string t, we search
for the short string s that maximizes P(s | t). This
is equivalent to searching for the s that maximizes
P(s) · P (t | s).

It is advantageous to break the problem down this
way, as it decouples the somewhat independent goals
of creating a short text that (1) looks grammatical,
and (2) preserves important information. It is easier to
build a channel model that focuses exclusively on the
latter, without having to worry about the former. That
is, we can specify that a certain substring may represent
unimportant information, but we do not need to worry
that deleting it will result in an ungrammatical struc-
ture. We leave that to the source model, which worries
exclusively about well-formedness. In fact, we can make
use of extensive prior work in source language modeling
for speech recognition, machine translation, and natu-
ral language generation. The same goes for actual com-
pression (“decoding” in noisy-channel jargon)—we can
re-use generic software packages to solve problems in all
these application domains.

Statistical Models

In the experiments we report here, we build very sim-

the above discussion and from previous work on statis-
tical channel models, we assign probabilities Ptree(s)
and Pexpand tree(t | s) to trees rather than strings. In
decoding a new string, we ﬁrst parse it into a large tree t
(using Collins’ parser (1997)), and we then hypothesize
and rank various small trees.

Good source strings are ones that have both (1) a
normal-looking parse tree, and (2) normal-looking word
pairs. Ptree(s) is a combination of a standard proba-
bilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) score, which is
computed over the grammar rules that yielded the tree
s, and a standard word-bigram score, which is com-
puted over the leaves of the tree. For example, the
tree s =(S (NP John) (VP (VB saw) (NP Mary))) is
assigned a score based on these factors:
Ptree(s) = P(TOP → S | TOP) ·
P(S → NP VP | S) · P(NP → John | NP) ·
P(VP → VB NP | VP) · P(VP → saw | VB) ·
P(NP → Mary | NP) ·
P(John | EOS) · P(saw | John) ·
P(Mary | saw) · P(EOS | Mary)

Our stochastic channel model performs minimal op-
erations on a small tree s to create a larger tree t. For
each internal node in s, we probabilistically choose an
expansion template based on the labels of the node and
its children. For example, when processing the S node
in the tree above, we may wish to add a prepositional
phrase as a third child. We do this with probability
P(S → NP VP PP | S → NP VP). Or we may choose
to leave it alone, with probability P(S → NP VP | S →
NP VP). After we choose an expansion template, then
for each new child node introduced (if any), we grow a
new subtree rooted at that node—for example (PP (P
in) (NP Pittsburgh)). Any particular subtree is grown
with probability given by its PCFG factorization, as
above (no bigrams).

Example

In this section, we show how to tell whether one poten-
tial compression is more likely than another, according
to the statistical models described above. Suppose we
observe the tree t in Figure 1, which spans the string
abcde. Consider the compression s1, which is shown in
the same ﬁgure.

A diﬀerent compression will be scored with a diﬀerent
set of factors. For example, consider a compression of
t that leaves t completely untouched. In that case, the
source costs Ptree(t) are:

Now we can simply compare Pexpand tree(s1 |

sus Pexpand tree(t | t) = Ptree(t) · Pexpand tree(t |
t))/Ptree(t) and select the more likely one. Note that
Ptree(t) and all the PCFG factors can be canceled out,
as they appear in any potential compression. Therefore,
we need only compare compressions of the basis of the
expansion-template probabilities and the word-bigram
probabilities. The quantities that diﬀer between the
two proposed compressions are boxed above. There-
fore, s1 will be preferred over t if and only if:

P(e | b) · P(A → C B D | A → C D) >
P(b | a) · P(c | b) · P(d | c) ·
P(A → C B D | A → C B D) ·
P(B → Q R | B → Q R) · P(Q → Z | Q → Z)

Training Corpus
In order to train our system, we used the Ziﬀ-Davis
corpus, a collection of newspaper articles announcing
computer products. Many of the articles in the corpus
are paired with human written abstracts. We automat-
ically extracted from the corpus a set of 1067 sentence
pairs. Each pair consisted of a sentence t = t1, t2, . . . , tn
that occurred in the article and a possibly compressed
version of it s = s1, s2, . . . , sm, which occurred in the
human written abstract. Figure 2 shows a few sentence
pairs extracted from the corpus.

We decided to use such a corpus because it is con-
sistent with two desiderata speciﬁc to summarization
(i) the human-written Abstract sentences are
work:

grammatical; (ii) the Abstract sentences represent in a
compressed form the salient points of the original news-
paper Sentences. We decided to keep in the corpus un-
compressed sentences as well, since we want to learn
not only how to compress a sentence, but also when to
do it.

(VP . . . )

Learning Model Parameters
We collect expansion-template probabilities from our
parallel corpus. We ﬁrst parse both sides of the parallel
corpus, and then we identify corresponding syntactic
nodes. For example, the parse tree for one sentence
may begin (S (NP . . . )
(PP . . . )) while
the parse tree for its compressed version may begin (S
(NP . . . ) (VP . . . )). If these two S nodes are deemed
to correspond, then we chalk up one joint event (S →
NP VP, S → NP VP PP); afterwards we normalize.
Not all nodes have corresponding partners; some non-
correspondences are due to incorrect parses, while oth-
ers are due to legitimate reformulations that are beyond
the scope of our simple channel model. We use standard
methods to estimate word-bigram probabilities.

Decoding
There is a vast number of potential compressions of a
large tree t, but we can pack them all eﬃciently into a
shared-forest structure. For each node of t that has n
children, we
• generate 2n − 1 new nodes, one for each non-empty

subset of the children, and

• pack those nodes so that they are referred to as a

whole.

For example, consider the large tree t above. All com-
pressions can be represented with the following forest:

A → B C H → a
G → H A B → R
C → b
Q → Z
G → H
A → C
Z → c
A → C B D A → B
G → A
R → d
A → D
B → Q R A → C B
D → e
A → C D
B → Q

We can also assign an expansion-template probability
to each node in the forest. For example, to the B →
Q node, we can assign P(B → Q R | B → Q). If the
observed probability from the parallel corpus is zero,
then we assign a small ﬂoor value of 10−6. In reality,
we produce forests that are much slimmer, as we only
consider compressing a node in ways that are locally
grammatical according to the Penn Treebank—if a rule
of the type A → C B has never been observed, then it
will not appear in the forest.

At this point, we want to extract a set of high-
scoring trees from the forest, taking into account
both expansion-template probabilities and word-bigram
probabilities. Fortunately, we have such a generic ex-
tractor on hand (Langkilde 2000). This extractor was
designed for a hybrid symbolic-statistical natural lan-
guage generation system called Nitrogen. In that ap-
plication, a rule-based component converts an abstract

semantic representation into a vast number of potential
English renderings. These renderings are packed into
a forest, from which the most promising sentences are
extracted using statistical scoring.

For our purposes, the extractor selects the trees with
the best combination of word-bigram and expansion-
template scores. It returns a list of such trees, one for
each possible compression length. For example, for
the sentence Beyond that basic level, the operations of
the three products vary, we obtain the following “best”
compressions, with negative log-probabilities shown in
parentheses (smaller = more likely):

Beyond that basic level, the operations of the three products vary

Length Selection
It is useful to have multiple answers to choose from, as
one user may seek a 20% compression, while another
seeks a 60% compression. However, for purposes of
evaluation, we want our system to be able to select a
single compression. If we rely on the log-probabilities
as shown above, we will almost always choose the short-
est compression. (Note above, however, how the three-
word compression scores better than the two-word com-
pression, as the models are not entirely happy removing
the article “the”). To create a more fair competition,
we divide the log-probability by the length of the com-
pression, rewarding longer strings. This is commonly
done in speech recognition.

If we plot this normalized score against compression
length, we usually observe a (bumpy) U-shaped curve,
In a typical more diﬃcult

case, a 25-word sentence may be optimally compressed
by a 17-word version. Of course, if a user requires a
shorter compression than that, she may select another
region of the curve and look for a local minimum.

A decision-based model for sentence
compression
In this section, we describe a decision-based, history
model of sentence compression. As in the noisy-channel
approach, we again assume that we are given as input

a parse tree t. Our goal is to “rewrite” t into a smaller
tree s, which corresponds to a compressed version of the
original sentence subsumed by t. Suppose we observe in
our corpus the trees t and s2 in Figure 1. In this model,
we ask ourselves how we may go about rewriting t into
s2. One possible solution is to decompose the rewriting
operation into a sequence of shift-reduce-drop actions
that are speciﬁc to an extended shift-reduce parsing
paradigm.

In the model we propose, the rewriting process starts
with an empty Stack and an Input List that contains the
sequence of words subsumed by the large tree t. Each
word in the input list is labeled with the name of all syn-
tactic constituents in t that start with it (see Figure 4).
At each step, the rewriting module applies an opera-
tion that is aimed at reconstructing the smaller tree s2.
In the context of our sentence-compression module, we
need four types of operations:
• shift operations transfer the ﬁrst word from the in-

put list into the stack;

• reduce operations pop the k syntactic trees located
at the top of the stack; combine them into a new
tree; and push the new tree on the top of the stack.
Reduce operations are used to derive the structure of
the syntactic tree of the short sentence.

• drop operations are used to delete from the input list
subsequences of words that correspond to syntactic
constituents. A drop x operations deletes from the

input list all words that are spanned by constituent
x in t.

• assignType operations are used to change the label
of trees at the top of the stack. These actions assign
POS tags to the words in the compressed sentence,
which may be diﬀerent from the POS tags in the
original sentence.

The decision-based model
is more ﬂexible than the
channel model because it enables the derivation of trees
whose skeleton can diﬀer quite drastically from that of
the tree given as input. For example, using the channel
model, we are unable to obtain tree s2 from t. However,
the four operations listed above enable us to rewrite a
tree t into any tree s, as long as an in-order traversal of
the leaves of s produces a sequence of words that occur
in the same order as the words in the tree t. For exam-
ple, the tree s2 can be obtained from tree t by following
this sequence of actions, whose eﬀects are shown in Fig-
ure 4: shift; assignType H; shift; assignType K;
reduce 2 F; drop B; shift; assignType D; reduce
2 G.

To save space, we show shift and assignType op-
erations on the same line; however, the reader should
understand that they correspond to two distinct ac-
tions. As one can see, the assignType K operation
rewrites the POS tag of the word b; the reduce op-
erations modify the skeleton of the tree given as input.
To increase readability, the input list is shown in a for-
mat that resembles as closely as possible the graphical
representation of the trees in ﬁgure 1.

Learning the parameters of the
decision-based model

We associate with each conﬁguration of our shift-
reduce-drop, rewriting model a learning case. The cases
are generated automatically by a program that derives
sequences of actions that map each of the large trees in
our corpus into smaller trees. The rewriting procedure
simulates a bottom-up reconstruction of the smaller
trees.

Overall, the 1067 pairs of long and short sentences
yielded 46383 learning cases. Each case was labeled

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with one action name from a set of 210 possible ac-
tions: There are 37 distinct assignType actions, one
for each POS tag. There are 63 distinct drop actions,
one for each type of syntactic constituent that can be
deleted during compression. There are 109 distinct re-
duce actions, one for each type of reduce operation that
is applied during the reconstruction of the compressed
sentence. And there is one shift operation. Given a
tree t and an arbitrary conﬁguration of the stack and
input list, the purpose of the decision-based classiﬁer
is to learn what action to choose from the set of 210
possible actions.

To each learning example, we associated a set of 99

features from the following two classes:

Operational features reﬂect the number of trees
the input list, and the types of
in the stack,
the last ﬁve operations. They also encode infor-
mation that denote the syntactic category of the
root nodes of the partial trees built up to a cer-
tain time. Examples of such features are: num-
berTreesInStack, wasPreviousOperationShift,
syn-
tacticLabelOfTreeAtTheTopOfStack, etc.

Original-tree-speciﬁc features denote the

syntac-
tic constituents that start with the ﬁrst unit in the
input list. Examples of such features are: inputList-
StartsWithA CC, inputListStartsWithA PP, etc.

The decision-based compression module uses the
C4.5 program (Quinlan 1993) in order to learn deci-
sion trees that specify how large syntactic trees can
be compressed into shorter trees. A ten-fold cross-
validation evaluation of the classiﬁer yielded an accu-
racy of 87.16% (± 0.14). A majority baseline classi-
ﬁer that chooses the action shift has an accuracy of
28.72%.

Employing the decision-based model

To compress sentences, we apply the shift-reduce-drop
model in a deterministic fashion. We parse the sentence
to be compressed (Collins 1997) and we initialize the
input list with the words in the sentence and the syn-
tactic constituents that “begin” at each word, as shown
in Figure 4. We then incrementally inquire the learned
classiﬁer what action to perform, and we simulate the
execution of that action. The procedure ends when the
input list is empty and when the stack contains only
one tree. An inorder traversal of the leaves of this tree
produces the compressed version of the sentence given
as input.

Since the model is deterministic, it produces only one
output. The advantage is that the compression is very
fast: it takes only a few milliseconds per sentence. The
disadvantage is that it does not produce a range of
compressions, from which another system may subse-
quently choose. It is straightforward though to extend
the model within a probabilistic framework by applying,
for example, the techniques used by Magerman (1995).

Evaluation
To evaluate our compression algorithms, we randomly
selected 32 sentence pairs from our parallel corpus,
which we will refer to as the Test Corpus. We used the
other 1035 sentence pairs for training. Figure 5 shows
three sentences from the Test Corpus, together with the
compressions produced by humans, our compression al-
gorithms, and a baseline algorithm that produces com-
pressions with highest word-bigram scores. The exam-
ples are chosen so as to reﬂect good, average, and bad
performance cases. The ﬁrst sentence is compressed in
the same manner by humans and our algorithms (the
baseline algorithm chooses though not to compress this
sentence). For the second example, the output of the
Decision-based algorithm is grammatical, but the se-
mantics is negatively aﬀected. The noisy-channel al-
gorithm deletes only the word “break”, which aﬀects
the correctness of the output less. In the last example,
the noisy-channel model is again more conservative and
decides not to drop any constituents. In constrast, the
decision-based algorithm compresses the input substan-
tially, but it fails to produce a grammatical output.

We presented each original sentence in the Test Cor-
pus to four judges, together with four compressions of it:
the human generated compression, the outputs of the
noisy-channel and decision-based algorithms, and the
output of the baseline algorithm. The judges were told
that all outputs were generated automatically. The or-
der of the outputs was scrambled randomly across test
cases.

To avoid confounding, the judges participated in two
experiments. In the ﬁrst experiment, they were asked
to determine on a scale from 1 to 5 how well the systems
did with respect to selecting the most important words
in the original sentence. In the second experiment, they
were asked to determine on a scale from 1 to 5 how
grammatical the outputs were.

We also investigated how sensitive our algorithms are
with respect to the training data by carrying out the
same experiments on sentences of a diﬀerent genre, the
scientiﬁc one. To this end, we took the ﬁrst sentence of
the ﬁrst 26 articles made available in 1999 on the cmplg
archive. We created a second parallel corpus, which
we will refer to as the Cmplg Corpus, by generating
by ourselves compressed grammatical versions of these
sentences. Since some of the sentences in this corpus
were extremely long, the baseline algorithm could not
produce compressed versions in reasonable time.

The results in Table 1 show compression rates, and
mean and standard deviation results across all judges,
for each algorithm and corpus. The results show that
the decision-based algorithm is the most aggressive:
on average, it compresses sentences to about half of
their original size. The compressed sentences produced
by both algorithms are more “grammatical” and con-
tain more important words than the sentences pro-
duced by the baseline. T -test experiments showed these
diﬀerences to be statistically signiﬁcant at p < 0.01
both for individual judges and for average scores across

all judges. T -tests showed no signiﬁcant statistical
diﬀerences between the two algorithms. As Table 1
shows, the performance of the compression algorithms
is much closer to human performance than baseline per-
formance; yet, humans perform statistically better than
our algorithms at p < 0.01.

When applied to sentences of a diﬀerent genre, the
performance of the noisy-channel compression algo-
rithm degrades smoothly, while the performance of the
decision-based algorithm drops sharply. This is due to
a few sentences in the Cmplg Corpus that the decision-
based algorithm over-compressed to only two or three
words. We suspect that this problem can be ﬁxed if
the decision-based compression module is extended in
the style of Magerman (1995), by computing probabil-
ities across the sequences of decisions that correspond
to a compressed sentence. Likewise, there are substan-
tial gains to be had in noisy-channel modeling—we see
clearly in the data many statistical dependencies and
processes that are not captured in our simple initial
models. More grammatical output will come from tak-
ing account of subcategory and head-modiﬁer statistics
(in addition to simple word-bigrams), and an expanded
channel model will allow for more tree manipulation
possibilities. Work on extending the algorithms pre-
sented in this paper to compressing multiple sentences
is currently underway.
